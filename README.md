# ToDo

## Descritpion
A simple todo list app. Main objectives were the following:
- Use webpack.
- Use Sass.
- Use ES6 modules.
- Further improve in Javascript Dom manipulation.


## Personal notes
Overall this was a fun project. I realize that there is still a lot of feautres that I can add, but frankly I want to move on to something else as this was getting time consumming
without much in return. Webpack and Sass are very usefull in the long term and I'm glad that I got introduced to them. I also used the delegate pattern for event handling. And I
purposefully wanted to generate the entire webpage using Javascripe. Will move on to deepen my knowledge in spring boot and react and other Javascript topics. Also, I'll probably
start using a CSS frameworks to save time on styling.
